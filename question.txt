Hi Kin,

Thank you for this.

Please see below details of your 48h data mining test.

Create a bot that extracts the following from people’s LinkedIn bio’s, into
a Google spreadsheet:

-

Email address
-

Linkedin profile name
-

Linkedin profile URL
-

Linkedin job title

Target accounts using either of these criterias:

-

People who have the word “mindfulness” or “meditation” as part of their
public profile, see here
<https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=meditation&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER>
-

Follows any of these
<https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?keywords=meditation&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER>
groups: https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?
keywords=meditation&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
<https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?keywords=meditation&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER>

You are free to use the language of your choice, however I can recommend
Python.

Share the Google Sheet with the output of the data, and send me the Github
URL as well.

You have got 48 hours from now, best of luck!
